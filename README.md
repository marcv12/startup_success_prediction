# Demystifying Startup Success
Crystal Ball for Startups: Predictive Modeling Meets Empirical Analysis to Unearth the Key to Startup Success!


## Description

Welcome aboard the voyage of discovery that is "Demystifying Startup Success"! This Final Year Project (FYP), which scored full marks, uses Crunchbase's rich dataset and the power of machine learning to provide insights into the journey of startups. By examining why 90% of startups fail, this project aims to steer entrepreneurs and investors towards better decisions, mitigating pitfalls and maximizing opportunities. The models developed through this research promise a high degree of reliability as the backbone of our claims is data - an asset that seldom lies. The two main stages of this project: data preparation and prediction modeling are represented as separate, but interconnected modules.

## Installation 

No additional libraries are needed to run this project beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code can be ran directly by you by making a copy of it and editing it in google colab. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation

The startup ecosystem has seen an explosion of activity in recent years. However, the high failure rate (90%) casts a shadow of uncertainty, creating a challenge for investors and entrepreneurs. A lack of financial records and proven track records further exacerbate this uncertainty. Through this research, we aim to harness data to navigate this uncertain world and guide investors and entrepreneurs alike. Covering multiple continents, we aspire to deliver universally applicable insights.

## File Descriptions

There are two primary scripts in this repository:

1. `crunchbase_cleanup.ipynb` - This script performs the data cleaning, feature engineering, and variable selection on the Crunchbase dataset, transforming numerous tables into a single, manageable dataframe.
2. `startup_predictor.ipynb` - This script takes the clean, prepared data from the previous script and leverages it to construct and train our predictive models.
